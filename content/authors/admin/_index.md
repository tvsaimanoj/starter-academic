I'm currently a Ph.D. Student in Computer Science at Missouri S&T. My advisor is [Prof. Tony Luo](https://tluocs.github.io). The current focus of my work is at the nexus of Artificial Intelligence, Cybersecurity & Internet of Things. I have previously worked on problems in Bitcoin, Permissioned & Private Blockchains and Social Network Analytics.

Before coming to S&T, I completed my Masters in Computer Science from University of Texas-Arlington. Previously, I worked as a Research Assistant at the Indian Institute of Science under [Prof. Y Narahari](https://gtl.csa.iisc.ac.in/hari/) and also as an intern at Dassault Syst√®mes, India. I obtained a B.E. in Computer Science & Engineering from MS Ramaiah Institute of Technology, India.

I am a Student Member of ACM & IEEE.
